            <p class="reveal">Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.
            Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s,
            when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type
            specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap
            into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was
            popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem
            Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus
            PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>

            <p class="reveal">It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the
            readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using
            Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as
            opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable
            English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem
            Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover
            many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the
            years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the
            like).</p>

            <p class="reveal">Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has
            roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000
            years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in
            Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a
            Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical
            literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections
            1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good
            and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of
            ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum,
            "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.</p>
